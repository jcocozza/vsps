# VSPS

VSPS stands for Very Simple Password Service.

It is a simple library for managing passwords via the CLI.

Everything is stored locally.

Under the hood, it is just a yaml file which can be edited directly.
Otherwise, it's just a bit of fluff on top.



## To Do

- account creation with auto password generation
- Simple GUI (probably via fyne)
- Implement Unit tests for testable stuff (maybe?)
- password length
